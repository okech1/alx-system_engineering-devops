API
API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of definitions and protocols that allow applications to communicate with each other. It acts as a messenger, enabling controlled access to a system's data and functionality.
Python Scripting and APIs

Python is a popular general-purpose programming language well-suited for working with APIs due to its:
Readability: Code is clear and concise, making API interaction easier to understand and maintain.
Abundant Libraries: A vast ecosystem of libraries like requests simplifies sending HTTP requests (the common way to interact with APIs) and handling responses.
Back-End Development and APIs

Back-end development focuses on the server-side logic of web applications, often dealing with databases, processing data, and handling API requests and responses.
APIs are crucial for back-end development as they allow:
External Applications to Access Data or Functionality: Build web applications that interact with services from other companies (e.g., social media logins, payment gateways).
Mobile Apps to Connect to Servers: Create mobile apps that communicate with your back-end servers to retrieve or update data.
Frontend Applications to Interact with Databases: Enable user interfaces (frontends) to interact with databases housed on back-end servers.
Here's a simplified example (using the popular requests library) that demonstrates how a Python script might interact with an API to fetch weather data:

Python
import requests

# Replace with the actual API URL and your API key (if required)
url = "https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=London&appid=YOUR_API_KEY"

response = requests.get(url)

if response.status_code == 200:
    # Parse the JSON response to extract weather information
    weather_data = response.json()
    temperature = weather_data["main"]["temp"] - 273.15  # Convert Kelvin to Celsius
    print(f"Current temperature in London: {temperature:.2f} degrees Celsius")
else:
    print("Error:", response.status_code)
Use code with caution.

In this example:

The script imports the requests library.
It defines a URL pointing to a weather API endpoint with your city (London) and potentially an API key (if required).
It sends a GET request to the API using requests.get().
The response is checked for successful status code (200).
If successful, the JSON response is parsed to extract the temperature.
The temperature is converted from Kelvin to Celsius and printed.
Otherwise, an error message is displayed.
